# Rust Workflow Server

Welcome to the Workflow Server project! This server is designed to be the backend for a project where users can efficiently manage their workflow. It leverages the Rust programming language, Tokio runtime, Axum web framework, and SeaORM as the ORM for PostgreSQL database. The combination of these powerful libraries ensures a reliable and scalable backend for your workflow management application.

## Getting Started

To start using the Rust Workflow Management Server, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, you can install it using Rustup.
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust_server.git
cd rust_server
```

## Dependencies

This project relies on several Rust libraries to provide a feature-rich workflow management experience:

**Tokio**: Asynchronous runtime for building scalable applications.
**Serde/JSON**: Serialization and deserialization library for working with JSON data.
**Axum**: A web framework built on top of Tokio for building scalable and composable services.
**SeaORM**: An async & dynamic ORM for Rust, used with PostgreSQL for efficient database operations.
**Dotenvy**: A library for loading environment variables from a .env file, simplifying configuration.
**jsonwebtoken**: JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation for secure authentication.
**bcrypt**: A library for secure password hashing using bcrypt.
**chrono**: Date and time library for handling time-related functionalities.
**validator**: A data validation library for ensuring data integrity.

## Configuration

Configure the server by setting up environment variables. Create a .env file in the project root and configure the following variables:

```dotenv
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/database
SECRET_KEY=my_secret_key
```

Adjust the values according to your local development environment.

## Usage

Build and run the server using the following commands:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

The server will start, and you can access it at http://127.0.0.1:8080/. Update the configuration in Cargo.toml or other relevant files to customize the server behavior.

## Features

The Rust Workflow Management Server provides the following features:

-   User authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
-   Secure password hashing with bcrypt.
-   Asynchronous handling of requests for scalability.
-   Seamless integration with PostgreSQL for efficient data storage.
